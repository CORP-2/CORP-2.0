# CORP 1.0

Before bureaucracy, things were done based on personal connections. Bureaucracy introduced rules, plans, and processes. It was initially helpful, especially when things were managed by feudal systems. However, this was the pre-industrial era.

What has changed in the 21st century: availability of instant information, global competition

## What works

* `Single point of contact` facilitates interactions with external entities such as customers, investors, partners, and governments
* Predictability
* 'Single point of contact' has only one official role (manager)
* Advances stability: globally adopted across countries and companies
* Enables ability to merge, split organizations
* Expedites capacity to achieve high growth
* Aids in more easily managing budget


## What doesn't work

* Too slow to react to both external and internal changes
* Information is blocked and skewed as it moves between and across layers
* Very slow feedback loops: when the organization is large, part of the organization can be mismanaged or abused, but it takes a long time for top decision makers to realize the problem and fix it; many times, the realization comes too late, resulting in the demise of the company, as feedback loops are not part of the organizational design
* Many people perform multiple roles, but they are officially recognized only for one role; in fact, high contributors who play multiple roles are treated the same as low contributors who play just one role
* Once the company reaches a certain size, higher growth is harder to achieve
* Grey areas and blind spots


~~A corporation is a collection of projects that are executed by groups of people. The projects are dynamic in nature: some are long running while other projects are short-lived. However, people who work on the projects are statically assigned through a rigid hierarchy. This rigid hierarchy has several problems, but it works to a certain degree and up to a certain point. The bureaucracy serves its purpose for the needs of investors, government and external entities. The right decisions are eventually made. For all of these needs, there is a single point of contact. This structure is perhaps the best way to deal with management of budget and money until a more sophisticated and fail-proof system is invented. However, the single point of contact often gets overwhelmed by other vital functions of a corporation, such as internal communication and decision making, because there is simply too much of it. Yet Corp 1.0 requires and depends on this single point of contact which potentially turns into a single point of failure, and no change has been introduced to this way of working until now.~~
