# CORP 1.0

## What works

* `Single point of contact` is easy for external entities such as  customers, investors, partners, government to deal with the company.
* Predictability.
* Person has only one official role.
* Globally adopted across countries and companies.
* Ability to merge, split Organizations.
* Ability to achieve high growth.
* Managing budget is easier.

## What doesn't work

* Too slow to react external and internal change.
* Information is blocked and skewed as it moves between layers and across.
* Very slow feedback loops. When the organization is large, part of the organization can be mismanaged or abused. But it takes a longtime for top decision makers to realize the problem and fix it. Many times, it is too late resulting in the demise of the company. feedback loops are not part of the design.
* Many people perform multiple roles, however officially recognized only for one role. In fact, high contributors who play multiple roles are treated same as low contributors who just one role.
* Once the company reaches a certain size, Higher growth is harder to achieve.
* Grey Areas, Blind spots.


A corporation is a collection of projects that are executed by groups of people. The projects are dynamic in nature: some are long running while other projects are short-lived. However, people who work on the projects are statically assigned through a rigid hierarchy. This rigid hierarchy has several problems, but it works to a certain degree and up to a certain point. The bureaucracy serves its purpose for the needs of investors, government and external entities. The right decisions are eventually made. For all of these needs, there is a single point of contact. This structure is perhaps the best way to deal with management of budget and money until a more sophisticated and fail-proof system is invented. However, the single point of contact often gets overwhelmed by other vital functions of a corporation, such as internal communication and decision making, because there is simply too much of it. Yet Corp 1.0 requires and depends on this single point of contact which potentially turns into a single point of failure, and no change has been introduced to this way of working until now.
