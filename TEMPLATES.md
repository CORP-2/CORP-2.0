# Templates

Templates are pre-defined methods to achieve a goal. For example, an initiative such as "implementing a time tracking system" can be a template. But they may differ between industries. "Time tracking system" differs vastly between medical industry and software industry. But, templates help standardize and measure the progress of goals within industries.

Templates are made up of a collection of `use cases`

In the first attempt we are only planning to address the software industry.

## Software Industry

### Creating an engineering initiative
### Implementing a time tracking system
### Launching a marketing campaign

## Medical Industry

## Transportation Industry
