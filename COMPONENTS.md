# Components

`Projects`, `Actions`, `Position`, `Skill` are the 4 building blocks that make up `corp 2.0`. They are intentionally designed to mirror the existing structure that is prevalent in mainstream organizations today.


## Projects

`Projects` are created from `templates.` A `project` is an initiative taken on by the company in order to achieve an objective.
For example, creating an engineering team.

`Templates` are predefined methods to perform the full lifecycle of a `project.`

For more details read [Templates](TEMPLATES.md)

## Actions

An `action` is an undertaking performed by an individual. `Actions` are performed based on the needs of an individual or of a `project.` Sometimes an `action` has more than one participant. For example, a `one-on-one` meeting is performed by two people with different roles. A `code-review`  can be performed by two people with the same roles. `Projects` are made up of `actions.`

An `action` is created from an `use case.` An `action` belongs to a `project.`

## Position

A `position` is roughly the equivalent of a `title.` As a person grows in his career, he or she may learn new things, thus performing various and different `roles`. Each `role` requires a certain `skill.` Each `role` requires the person to be responsible for his or her `actions` and provides the necessary authority for the person to execute the responsibilities necessary for the role.

## Skill

A `skill` is required by a `role` for performing an `action.` A `skill` is basically knowledge or talent that a person possesses that allows him or her to fulfill work duties.
