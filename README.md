# Why

 Every organization in the world is made up of people and managed via bureaucratic means. While bureaucracy works, it is inefficient, very slow, and open to abuse of power. In essence, bureaucracy in its current state is outdated for the modern world.

# Corp 1.0

Let's call any company that has `hierarchical` structure and operates on `command-and-control` model a `Corp 1.0` company.

The advantages and disadvantages of `Corp 1.0` are described [here](CORP_1.0.md).

# Corp 2.0

`Corp 2.0` aims to simplify and modernize bureaucracy in medium and large companies.

Corp 2.0 strives to fix the broken aspects of `Corp 1.0` while allowing the parts that work well to remain. For example, the idea is not to eliminate hierarchy, but rather to streamline it. The `single point of contact` works well dealing with external entities such as government(s), investors, customers etc. so there need not be drastic changes to the external face of the company.

However the `single point of contact` is oftentimes a disaster for internal communication and decision making. `Corp 2.0` tries to reduce `single point of contacts` and increases visibility into `decision making.`  

## Goals of Corp 2.0

***Corp 2.0 is focused on engineering organizations, where ~75% of communication is electronic and work is ~90% electronic in nature.***

The principal goals of `Corp 2.0` are:

* Discover information from interactions
* Faster feedback loops
* Continuous objective evaluation of employees
* Backward compatibility, gradual onboarding, iteration
* Collective management with multiple data points

Further details about goals are provided in the [Goals](GOALS.md) page.
