# CORP-2.0

Virtually every organization in the world is made up of people and managed via bureaucratic means. While bureaucracy works, it is inefficient, very slow, and open to abuse of power. In essence, bureaucracy in its current state, is totally outdated for the modern world. Corp 2.0 aims to simplify and modernize bureaucracy in medium and large companies.

# Goals

The ultimate goal is streamlining bureaucracy. However, the major differentiators and principal goals of CORP 2.0 are:

* Continuous objective evaluation of employees
* Collective management with multiple data points
* Gradual on-boarding, iteration, and backward compatibility

Further details about goals are provided in the [Goals](GOALS.md) page.

# Corp 1.0

A corporation is a collection of projects that are executed by groups of people. The projects are dynamic in nature: some are long running while other projects are short-lived. However, people who work on the projects are statically assigned through a rigid hierarchy. This rigid hierarchy has several problems, but it works to a certain degree and up to a certain point. The bureaucracy serves its purpose for the needs of investors, government and external entities. The right decisions are eventually made. For all of these needs, there is a single point of contact. This structure is perhaps the best way to deal with management of budget and money until a more sophisticated and fail-proof system is invented. However, the single point of contact often gets overwhelmed by other vital functions of a corporation, such as internal communication and decision making, because there is simply too much of it. Yet Corp 1.0 requires and depends on this single point of contact which potentially turns into a single point of failure, and no change has been introduced to this way of working until now.

# Corp 2.0

Corp 2.0 strives to fix the broken aspects of Corp 1.0 while allowing the parts that work well to remain. For example, the idea is not to eliminate hierarchy, but rather to simplify it. The `single point of contact` works well dealing with external entities such as government(s), investors, customers etc. so there need not be drastic changes to the external face of the company.

However the `single point of contact` is oftentimes a disaster for internal communication and decision making. `Corp 2.0` tries to reduce `single point of contacts` and increases visibility into `decision making` whether it is `single-point` or `collective.`  

## Projects

`Projects` are created from `Templates.` A `Project` is an initiative taken on by the company in order to achieve an objective.
For example, creating an engineering team.

`Templates` are predefined methods to perform the full lifecycle of a `Project.`

## Actions

An `Action` is an undertaking performed by an individual. `Actions` are performed based on the needs of an individual or of a `Project.` Sometimes an `action` has more than one participant. For example, a `one-on-one` meeting is performed by two people with different roles. A `code-review`  can be performed by two people with the same roles. `Projects` are made up of `Actions.`

An `Action` is created from an `Use case.` An `Action` belongs to a `Project.`
