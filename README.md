# Why

 Every organization in the world is made up of people and managed via bureaucratic means. While bureaucracy works, it is inefficient, very slow, and open to abuse of power. In essence, bureaucracy in its current state is outdated for the modern world.

# Corp 1.0

Let's call any company that has `hierarchical` structure and operates on `command-and-control` model a `Corp 1.0` company.

The advantages and disadvantages of `Corp 1.0` are described [here](CORP_1.0.md).

# Corp 2.0

`Corp 2.0` aims to simplify and modernize bureaucracy in medium and large companies.

Corp 2.0 strives to fix the broken aspects of `Corp 1.0` while allowing the parts that work well to remain. For example, the idea is not to eliminate hierarchy, but rather to streamline it. The `single point of contact` works well dealing with external entities such as government(s), investors, customers etc. so there need not be drastic changes to the external face of the company.

However the `single point of contact` is oftentimes a disaster for internal communication and decision making. `Corp 2.0` tries to reduce `single point of contacts` and increases visibility into `decision making.`  

## Goals of Corp 2.0

***Corp 2.0 is focused on engineering organizations, where ~75% of communication is electronic and work is ~90% electronic in nature.***

The principal goals of `Corp 2.0` are:

* Faster feedback loops
* Continuous objective evaluation of employees
* Backward compatibility, gradual onboarding, iteration
* Collective management with multiple data points

Further details about goals are provided in the [Goals](GOALS.md) page.


## Components of Corp 2.0

The following are the backbone of `Corp 2.0`.

What | How | Description |
--- | --- |---|
Template | Project | Projects are created from templates
Use case| Action | Actions are created from use cases
Role | Position | A position is made up of roles; each role requires a special skill, provides some responsibility and provides the necessary authority to execute those responsibilities
 |Skill| An ability to perform an action


## Projects

`Projects` are created from `templates.` A `project` is an initiative taken on by the company in order to achieve an objective.
For example, creating an engineering team.

`Templates` are predefined methods to perform the full lifecycle of a `project.`

## Actions

An `action` is an undertaking performed by an individual. `Actions` are performed based on the needs of an individual or of a `project.` Sometimes an `action` has more than one participant. For example, a `one-on-one` meeting is performed by two people with different roles. A `code-review`  can be performed by two people with the same roles. `Projects` are made up of `actions.`

An `action` is created from an `use case.` An `action` belongs to a `project.`

## Position

A `position` is roughly the equivalent of a `title.` As a person grows in his career, he or she may learn new things, thus performing various and different `roles`. Each `role` requires a certain `skill.` Each `role` requires the person to be responsible for his or her `actions` and provides the necessary authority for the person to execute the responsibilities necessary for the role.

## Skill

A `skill` is required by a `role` for performing an `action.` A `skill` is basically knowledge or talent that a person possesses that allows him or her to fulfill work duties.
