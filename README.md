# CORP-2.0

Virtually every organization in the world is made up of people and managed via bureaucratic means. While bureaucracy works, it is inefficient, very slow and open to abuse of power. In essence, bureaucracy in its current state, is totally outdated for the modern world. Corp 2.0 aims to simplify and modernize management in medium and large companies.

# Goals

The ultimate goal is streamlining bureaucracy. However, the major differentiators and principal goals of CORP 2.0 are:

* Continuous objective evaluation of employees
* Collective management with multiple data points
* Gradual onboarding, iteration, and backward compatibility

Further details about goals are provided in the [Goals](GOALS.md) page.

# Corp 1.0

A corporation is a collection of projects that performed by group(s) people. The projects are dynamic in nature. Some projects are long running, while some are short paced. However, people who execute the project are statically assigned through a rigid hierarchy. The rigid hierarchy has several problems, But it kind of works. Right decisions are eventually made. The bureaucracy serves its purpose for the needs of investors, government and external entities. For all these needs there is a single point of contact. However, the single point of contact gets overwhelmed for internal communication and decision making. Because there is just too much of it. Also, another important role of rigid hierarchy is management of budget. Single point of contact is perhaps the best way to deal with money unless a sophisticated and fail-proof system is invented.

# Corp 2.0

Corp 2.0 tries to fix the broken aspects of Corp 1.0 while leaving the parts that work well. For example, the idea is not to eliminate hierarchy, But simplify it. The `single point of contact` works well dealing with external entities such as government(s), investors, customers etc. So, there are no changes to the external face of the company.

However the `single point of contact` is a disaster for internal communication and decision making. But there are exceptions. `Corp 2.0` tries to reduce `single point of contacts` and increases visibility towards `decision making` whether it is `single-point` or `collective`.  

## Projects

`Projects` are created from `Templates`. `Project` is an initiative by the company to achieve an objective.
For example, creating an engineering team.

`Templates` are predefined methods to perform the full lifecycle of a `Project`.

## Actions

`Action` is performed by an individual. `Actions` are performed based on the needs of an individual or of a `Project`. Sometimes an `action` has more than one participant. Example, `one-on-one` meeting is performed by two people with different roles. `code-review`  can be performed by two people with the same roles. `Projects` are made up of `Actions`.

`Action` is created from an `Use case`. `Action` belongs to a `Project`.
