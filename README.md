# Why

 Every organization in the world is made up of people and managed via bureaucratic means. While bureaucracy works, it is inefficient, very slow, and open to abuse of power. In essence, bureaucracy in its current state, is outdated for the modern world.

# Corp 1.0

Let's say, a company that has `hierarchical` structure and operates on `command-and-control` model as a `corp 1.0` company.

[corp 1.0](CORP_1.0.md) has several issues and based on assumptions that are no-longer true.

# Corp 2.0

Corp 2.0 aims to simplify and modernize bureaucracy in medium and large companies.

Corp 2.0 strives to fix the broken aspects of `corp 1.0` while allowing the parts that work well to remain. For example, the idea is not to eliminate hierarchy, but rather to simplify it. The `single point of contact` works well dealing with external entities such as government(s), investors, customers etc. so there need not be drastic changes to the external face of the company.

However the `single point of contact` is oftentimes a disaster for internal communication and decision making. `Corp 2.0` tries to reduce `single point of contacts` and increases visibility into `decision making.`  

# Goals

The principal goals of `corp 2.0` are:

* Faster feedback loops
* Continuous objective evaluation of employees
* Backward compatibility, Gradual on-boarding, iteration
* Collective management with multiple data points

Further details about goals are provided in the [Goals](GOALS.md) page.



## Projects

`Projects` are created from `Templates.` A `Project` is an initiative taken on by the company in order to achieve an objective.
For example, creating an engineering team.

`Templates` are predefined methods to perform the full lifecycle of a `Project.`

## Actions

An `Action` is an undertaking performed by an individual. `Actions` are performed based on the needs of an individual or of a `Project.` Sometimes an `action` has more than one participant. For example, a `one-on-one` meeting is performed by two people with different roles. A `code-review`  can be performed by two people with the same roles. `Projects` are made up of `Actions.`

An `Action` is created from an `Use case.` An `Action` belongs to a `Project.`
