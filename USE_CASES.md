# Use cases

Use cases are pre-defined methods for the interaction of an individual with others or the corporation. Use cases are smaller events such as a meeting, interview, review etc. The idea is the measure the outcome of these `use cases` as employees experience them. As much as possible, the outcome of the `use cases` are inferred, rather than fed directly to the system.

Each `use case` has a clear pre-defined template, that has the role of each person and the expected outcome from each person. The system will determine the outcome of the `use case` based data points it can gather from various sources such as calendaring system, code repository, tracking system etc.

Here are some sample use cases
